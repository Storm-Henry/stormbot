## How to run the bot
The bot is pretty easy to setup, just open your terminal and navigate to the folder that the bot is in, then type


> npm install

Then to run the bot

> node app.js

I tried to make the bot as simple and light weight as possible. There is plenty of room for improvement and should easily be customizable for anyone to use. There is some documentation that you can use to help you write custom commands here: https://docs.tmijs.org/

## Bot commands
The bot responds only to commands that have a exclaimation mark (!) before the word. The list of commands is as follows:
* !addDeath - This command will add a death to the counter



Will complete this later...
